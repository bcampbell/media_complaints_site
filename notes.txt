django upgrade notes
--------------------

Currently using very old version of django (1.2.x).

Lots of little things to upgrade:

per-year filters in admin: used to use contrib FilterSpecs, but that's been
replaced:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter

manage.py needs upgrade: execute_manager() removed in 1.5/1.6
